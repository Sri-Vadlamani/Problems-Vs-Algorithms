The repository has seven codes in python which covers a variety of topics related to the data structures.

## Finding the Square Root of an Integer
The goal will be to find the floor value of square root of the integer without using any Python library.

##  Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
The goal is to search for a target value in a given sorted array which is rotated at some random pivot point. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1. Algorithm's runtime complexity is in the order of O(log n).

## Rearrange Array Elements
Rearrange Array Elements so as to form two number such that their sum is maximum without using any sorting function that Python provides and the expected time complexity is O(nlog(n)).

## Dutch National Flag Problem
The goal is to sort the array in a single traversal for the given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, without using any sorting function that Python provides.

## Autocomplete with Tries
 A trie is a tree like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings. Tries are commonly used to facilitate operations like predictive text or autocomplete features on mobile phones or web search.The goal is to create a autocomplete function using a working trie for storing strings.

## Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
The goal is to find the smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time without using Python's inbuilt functions.

## HTTP Router using a Trie
The goal is to implement an HTTPRouter like you would find in a typical web server using the Trie data structure we learned previously.
