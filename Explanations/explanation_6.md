### Description:
Max and Min in a Unsorted Array: The code returns smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers.

### Algorithm:
Its a general algorithm which traverses through all the elements for comparison.

### Implementation process:
Traverse array elements and compare every element with current max and current min and return max and min integer from the array list

### Time Complexity:
In the general case finding the minimum or maximum of a unsorted collection of values requires to look at each value thus,
Time complexity  = O(n)

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity O(1).
