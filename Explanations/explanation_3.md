### Description:
The goal is to write code to Rearrange Array Elements so as to form two number such that their sum is maximum

### Algorithm:
The algorithm used to sort the integers in descending order is mergesort.

### Implementation process:
We need two numbers such that their sum is maximum, then we would also need two maximum numbers. If we arrange our array in descending order then we can get two digits that will form the largest numbers.

### Time Complexity: O(n)
O(logn) for sorting. O(n) for picking two numbers
The time complexity is O(nlogn).
 
### Space Complexity:
Space complexity is O(n). Where, n are the number of elements.
